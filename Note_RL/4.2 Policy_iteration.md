$\diamond$ The first is a policy evaluation step. As its name suggests, this step evaluates a given policy by calculating the corresponding state value. That is to solve the following Bellman equation:

$$
v_{\pi_k}=r_{\pi_k}+\gamma P_{\pi_k} v_{\pi_k},
$$
$\diamond$ The second is a policy improvement step. As its name suggests, this step is used to improve the policy. In particular, once $v_{\pi_k}$ has been calculated in the first step, a new policy $\pi_{k+1}$ can be obtained as

$$
\pi_{k+1}=\arg \max _\pi\left(r_\pi+\gamma P_\pi v_{\pi_k}\right) .
