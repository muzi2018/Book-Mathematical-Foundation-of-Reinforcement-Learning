why state value: returns just can be used to evaluate policies with stochastic systems, when they are applied to stochastic systems, they need consider the mean or expectation

consider a trajectory:

$S_t \xrightarrow{A_t} S_{t+1}, R_{t+1} \xrightarrow{A_{t+1}} S_{t+2}, R_{t+2} \xrightarrow{A_{t+2}} S_{t+3}, R_{t+3} \ldots$

we get a return

$G_t \doteq R_{t+1}+\gamma R_{t+2}+\gamma^2 R_{t+3}+\ldots$

when we get a lots of trajectories, then we calculate its expected value which is called the **state-value function**

$v_\pi(s) \doteq \mathbb{E}\left[G_t \mid S_t=s\right]$
