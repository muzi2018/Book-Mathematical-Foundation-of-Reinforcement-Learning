from sympy import symbols, solve, Max
# x=\max _{y \in \mathbb{R}}\left(2 x-1-y^2\right) .
# Define the variables
x, y = symbols('x y')

# Define the function we need to maximize with respect to y
function = 2 * x - 1 - y**2

# Step 1: Solve for y by finding the maximum of the function with respect to y
y_max = Max(function, y).subs(y, 0)  # The maximum is achieved when y=0

# Step 2: Substitute y=0 into the original equation and solve for x
equation = x - (2 * x - 1)  # The equation simplifies to x = 2*x - 1 when y=0
solution_x = solve(equation, x)[0]

# Print the results
print(f"The solution for x is: {solution_x}")
print(f"The solution for y is: {y_max}")
